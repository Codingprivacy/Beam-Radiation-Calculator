? Latitude, the angular location north or south of the equator, north positive; ?90? ? ?
? 90?.

? Declination, the angular position of the sun at solar noon (i.e., when the sun is on the
local meridian) with respect to the plane of the equator, north positive; ?23.45? ? ?
? 23.45?.

? Slope, the angle between the plane of the surface in question and the horizontal; 0? ?
? ? 180?. (? > 90? means that the surface has a downward-facing component.)

? Surface azimuth angle, the deviation of the projection on a horizontal plane of the
normal to the surface from the local meridian, with zero due south, east negative, and
west positive; ?180? ? ? ? 180?.

? Hour angle, the angular displacement of the sun east or west of the local meridian
due to rotation of the earth on its axis at 15? per hour; morning negative, afternoon
positive.

? Angle of incidence, the angle between the beam radiation on a surface and the normal
to that surface.
